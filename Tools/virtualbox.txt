Take a snapshot
From the Virtual Box GUI (Virtualbox Manager) we can easily take a snaphot from a running virtual machine by selecting Take Snapshot or pressing HOST+T:
This will open a dialog to give in a sensible name and optionally a description of this snapshot:
The snapshot will then be saved in the machine's directory (depending on the size of the machine this may take a while.

On the command line the same can be achieved by
VBoxManage snapshot <Name_of_VM> take <Name_of_Snapshot>

Restore a snapshot
From the Virtualbox Manager we can restore to any snapshot by selecting a machine, then pressing then Snapshots (1) button on top right:
Select the appropriate snapshot from the list, then press enter image description here to restore this snapshot.
The current state of the machine will then be lost. To also restore the current state we will first have to create a snapshot too.

Restoring a snapshot from the command line is done with
VBoxManage snapshot <Name_of_VM> restore <Name_of_Snapshot>
