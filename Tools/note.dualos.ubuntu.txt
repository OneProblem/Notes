goal - install ubuntu os which can co-exist with win8 in my pc environment.

I know how to do it in virtual-box, but that does not fully use the GPU I have for my pc.
If I can install a physical ubuntu, maybe it can use GPU in ubuntu env.

1.Allocate a free disk
control panel -> system and security -> administrative tools -> computer management
storage -> disk management
shrink existing disk and make some space as unknow (step3 when installing ubuntu

2.Create Ubuntu xx.xx disk based on the ISO file

3.Start with hard-disk boot
Choose an option -> Troubleshoot -> Advanced options -> UEFI Firmware Settings

4.Install Ubuntu xx.xx
Reserved BIOS boot area
/
/home

5.Installation in Ubuntu
a)nvidia driver for GPU
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nvidia-390
lsmod | grep nvidia
sudo apt-mark hold nvidia-390

b)grub menu
sudo update-grub
