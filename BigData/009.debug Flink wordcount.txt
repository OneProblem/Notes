1. Import the built project, K:\HadoopDev\flink132_s2118_read, into IntelliJ as maven project.

2. Figure out a lot of dependent issues with library/module.

2.1 Error:java: Compilation failed: internal java compiler error
There is such a compilation error, could not figure out for quite some time.
Finally, adding the hadoop-mapreduce-client-core library in solves this compilation error. (a little bit strange).

3. Dependency among the flink modules.
