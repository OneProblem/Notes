Error:scalac: missing or invalid dependency detected while loading class file 'ExecutionEnvironment.class'.
Could not access term esotericsoftware in package com,
because it (or its dependencies) are missing. Check your build definition for
missing or conflicting dependencies. (Re-run with `-Ylog-classpath` to see the problematic classpath.)
A full rebuild may help if 'ExecutionEnvironment.class' was compiled against an incompatible version of com.
