I built the source code v1.5.1 on windows and ubuntu 16.10.
But when running the unittest, ubuntu works but not on windows.
After investigation, it is because of the case-insensitive for folder name, agrona, on windows.
So on windows, remove Gradle: agrona module from Libraries, and add a new library as agrona lib.
