1. eclipse_cpp.sh
In ubuntu, if you are using eclipse. when launching it, the eclipse's menu will be gone.
So here is the solution to make the menu show up.
Create an eclipse_cpp.sh, and put the following content into this sh file (note, put your own eclipse path)

[Desktop Entry] 
Type=Application 
Name=Eclipse 
Icon=eclipse 
Exec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= /home/zbhuang/Downloads/eclipse_cpp/eclipse 
Terminal=false 
Categories=Development;IDE;Java;

2. checking the data in c++ vector inside eclipse
I find it is difficult to check the std::string content in the c++ vector for the debugging purpose.
I have to use print statement.
I thought it was eclipse's issue.
Then in my home vm environment, I found it is not because of eclipse, it might because of gdb used in eclipse.
Need to double check my observation.
